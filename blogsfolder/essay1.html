  <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
  <p class="e-content">
    The digital presence of educational institutions carries more than just information; it reflects credibility, ethos, and user values.
    The Parktown Boys' High School website, a prominent online portal for a prestigious Johannesburg-based school, is designed to inform current and prospective students, parents, and donors.
    However, beyond functionality, its design subtly deploys techniques to influence user behaviour, raising questions around ethics in interface and interaction design.
  </p>
   <p class="e-content">
    Web interaction is governed by two foundational concepts: <strong>User Interface (UI)</strong> and <strong>User Experience (UX)</strong>.
    UI encompasses the layout and visual elements users interact with, while UX considers the emotional and cognitive experience during that interaction.
    Recent literature, especially Chamorro et al.'s work on persuasive versus manipulative design, introduces a critical tension in digital design: the line between persuasion, which respects user agency, and manipulation, which subverts it [1].
  </p>
   <p class="e-content">Several terms are key to this discussion:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Deception:</strong> Making false or misleading statements deliberately.</li>
    <li><strong>Coercion:</strong> Reducing or eliminating alternatives, giving users no real choice.</li>
    <li><strong>Salience:</strong> How visible or obvious the influence mechanism is to the user.</li>
    <li><strong>Force:</strong> How much the design limits or guides the user's actions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="e-content">
    This essay examines how the Parktown Boys’ website uses persuasive design strategies (some arguably crossing ethical boundaries) through its UI and UX.
    Drawing from academic literature and a close reading of the site’s layout and content, this paper reflects on ethical tensions and proposes a more responsible approach to digital interaction.
  </p>

  <h2>II. Website Overview: UI, UX, and Pretext</h2>
   <p class="e-content">
    The Parktown Boys’ website appears at first to be clear and hierarchical in structure. It includes navigation menus, media-rich sections, and informational content.
  </p>
   <p class="e-content">
    They use a simple contrast palette of white text on black (#181A1B) with red (#EA5055) highlights. However, the red on black fails the WCAG AAA contrast test, illustrating poor visibility and reduced accessibility.
    The site is only in English, which limits accessibility, especially for parents and donors in a multilingual country like South Africa.
  </p>
   <p class="e-content">
    The UI includes buttons, links, and icons to navigate and access information. It mostly uses buttons for internal interaction and text links only for PDFs.
    Icons are used to link to external platforms like Facebook or Instagram, which helps simplify options as per Hick's Law [4], but lacks hover/alt text for accessibility.
  </p>
  <p class="e-content">
    The text layout is inconsistent — misaligned text and unordered dropdown menus make the site feel messy and hard to navigate.
    Despite some conventional UI elements, the structure ultimately prioritizes institutional goals over ease of use.
  </p>

  <h2>III. Coercive Redirection Through Payment Portals</h2>
 <p class="e-content">
    A major ethical issue is found in the website’s shop and donation portals hosted on external domains.
    Once users enter, they lose site navigation and can only donate, shop, or exit — a tactic high in force and salience.
    This reflects coercion [1] and obstruction [3], violating Nielsen's “User control and freedom” heuristic [2].
  </p>
  <p class="e-content">
    Users must backtrack manually to exit, reinforcing how navigation is deliberately limited to encourage financial interaction.
    This challenges ethical UI practices, especially in a school setting.
  </p>

  <h2>IV. Visual Direction and Manipulative Layout</h2>
    <p class="e-content">
    The site uses Z- and F-pattern visual layouts with standout buttons ("Donate", "Add Me to the Database") to direct attention.
    This employs the <strong>Von Restorff effect</strong> — users remember the most visually distinct items [4].
    These persuasive visual hierarchies risk becoming manipulative if they reduce user freedom [1].
  </p>
    <p class="e-content">
    Though effective from a branding standpoint, such patterns may undermine trust and user autonomy, conflicting with heuristics like “Flexibility and efficiency of use” [2].
  </p>

  <h2>V. Deceptive Content Through Outdated Claims</h2>
    <p class="e-content">
    The homepage includes a banner claiming Parktown Boys is a top-ten school in Gauteng, but it’s undated.
    In fact, recent rankings place it 33rd nationally [6]. This constitutes <strong>deception</strong> by omission, as it may mislead users with outdated information.
    Such practices are especially unethical in educational contexts.
  </p>

  <h2>VI. Ethical Responsibility and Stakeholder Trust</h2>
    <p class="e-content">
    Schools serve minors, families, and the public — a user base that deserves transparency and trust.
    Designers must resist institutional pressure to use manipulative techniques and prioritize ethical practices instead.
  </p>
    <p class="e-content">
    Chamorro et al. argue designers work in imbalanced power structures where business goals often override ethics [1].
    In schools, this imbalance must be countered with a commitment to honesty and accessibility.
  </p>

  <h2>VII. Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="e-content">
    The Parktown Boys High School website is visually appealing but raises ethical concerns.
    Using coercive redirection, visual manipulation, and outdated claims, it undermines user autonomy in subtle but impactful ways.
  </p>
    <p class="e-content">
    This essay, using Chamorro et al.'s framework of salience, force, deception, and coercion, argues that UI design should uphold transparency and respect user agency — especially in public-serving institutions like schools.
