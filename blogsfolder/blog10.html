The text “Internet Access is a Fundamental Right. Especially, Amidst a Pandemic” explores the idea of internet access becoming a human right. I agree with the points made in support of internet access being recognized as a human right.
The key issues used to validate this statement are access to information and education, the right to work, and the right to life — all of which are considered human rights [2]. A human right is defined as “rights inherent to all human beings, regardless of race, sex, nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, or any other status.” These are aspects of life that all humans should have access to. The article uses COVID-19 to highlight that during the pandemic, those with internet access were able to attend school digitally and continue their education. They were also kept updated on accurate information related to the virus. This meant their lives and health had a better chance of being protected through access to correct practices, knowledge of doctors, and information about vaccine locations. Additionally, people with internet access were able to find or create work by marketing their services online. Although these examples come from an extreme situation, they help isolate the impact that the internet has on people’s ability to access other human rights. Without it, millions risk being left behind, widening the gap between the digitally connected and the disconnected. This creates a situation where those offline are excluded from essential services and civic participation.
Based on this, it’s easy to agree with the statement, but I want to look more closely at the implications of making internet access a human right. It would fall on governments to uphold this right. However, many human rights are still being violated around the world [3]. As one article puts it, “the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is still more a dream than reality.” Making internet access a human right might be a step in the right direction toward acknowledging the importance of human rights, but it will not fix the deeper issues it highlights. In today’s world, access to the internet is essential to access the opportunities discussed in the article. However, making it a human right should not be seen as the final goal. There must also be policies ensuring not just access, but quality and affordability. Otherwise, even with official recognition, people in rural or low-income areas may remain excluded due to slow speeds, high costs, or censorship.
Additionally, how would everyone access the internet? Internet access requires electricity and devices capable of connecting to the web. Furthermore, how many devices should be available per person? These would all be major costs for governments to consider, and they would likely need to be funded by the people. Depending on how each government chooses to raise these funds, it could have an economic impact on citizens. This could create additional pressure for the very people the right is meant to support. Therefore, while I agree with recognizing internet access as a human right, implementing this right in a meaningful and fair way would be a difficult and complex challenge. Collaboration between public and private sectors could offer solutions, for example: subsidized data plans, infrastructure investments in underserved regions, or community internet hubs. These would help translate the principle into practical access.
Beyond this, the article poses the question: “What should be the rules governing the internet, and who will set them?” A body that has the power to control the internet would be extremely powerful, especially in terms of pushing certain agendas. There is a need to restrict certain content — such as videos of crimes being committed — but a single committee with this authority would need to be a neutral and detached organization, much like the United Nations is for international law. Alternatively, each government could choose what information is accessible. This is already how internet restrictions often work today, but it can lead to propaganda and the limitation of news and current events. Finding a balance between safety and freedom of expression remains a major challenge. If the wrong entities gain control, the internet could shift from being a tool of empowerment to one of manipulation and surveillance.
