          <p class="e-content">File Structure
            The file structure will be laid out  where the root file will be the main folder which houses all other folders. It will contain folders index, blog, design, profile, portfolio (all folders just mentioned will have folders with code specific for them), scripts, images, styles. This simple layout will allow for easy access to all folders and ease traversal between the pages. The images and styles folders may need to be modifies so that there is a dedicated folder for each sub folder (eg an images and styles folder in the Index folder) just for speed and efficiency reasons however that will have to be tested further along the line. 
            
            Root(DIGA3008A)
            Index 
                Index specific code
                Blog
                    Blog specific code
                Design
                    Design specific code
                Profile 
                    Profile specific code
                Portfolio
                    Portfolio specific code
                Scripts
                Images
                Styles
            My URL will simply be the username of my GitHub followed by the path to the page based on the hierarchy listed above. For example, the Blog page will be ali-r-glitch.github.io/DIGA3008A/Blogs. This is to keep the hierarchy digestible and keep traversal as simple as possible.
            
            Wireframes and ideas. There are a few ideas that I want to see come to life. 
            Ideas 1: simple
            A simple and straightforward website with simple code.
            
               
            Idea 2: Images
            Using static or animated images that the user can’t interact with. I would like to use images related to me as a digital arts engineer. For example I would like to use a game controller for the homepage where each button would represent a page on the website.  
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            Idea 3: maps 
            Im inspired by the websites of  Immersive Gardens[1]. A 3D map like website in which the user can explore and move around in. The user can hover over a piece of land which will highlight it. If clicked the camera user will be moved to that area. 
            
            Reflection on the world wide web
            I find the word interaction difficult in itself. My understanding of it is a predictable or non-random reaction to user input that may change the context or content of the text. My struggle in understanding the definition is what level of cognitive effort is required to be considered user input. Based on context and the user personally, something could be interactive. A hypothetical person who has never used technology would find no computer, mouse interaction or website interactive. The subjectivity of a concept that I thought was originally simple has changed my perception of the world wide web. When designing the Ui for the website I think I might fail to grapple with when to use links, previews and how to create a flow of the website so that the website is predictable yet interesting to view. The balance of knowing what is coming but interestingly presented might be difficult to achieve.  
            
            Reflection on the reading “You want a revolution?”
            
            In the reading I found the most interesting point made was what hypertext would make obsolete. In the text it states that books would not become obsolete, but post literacy would be obsolete. I understand post literacy as the people losing interest in using and engaging with traditional forms of reading and writing. This poses that the implementation of the non linear “storytelling” ability of hypertext would revitalise reading and writing in a new interactive manner. I find this to be true in my experience as I struggle to enjoy reading, however it hypertext makes gathering of information easier and  quicker due to the non linearity as I may quickly go to more information on a term I unsure of or skip ahead of needless information that I am informed about. This does create a medium in which I enjoy reading.
