              Grok’s White Genocide Claims
Introduction
In the age of generative AI and algorithmic decision-making, the internet has become a critical space where geopolitical power, cultural narratives, and digital infrastructures intersect. One emerging concern is digital coloniality, the extension of historical colonial power structures into digital realms. This manifests when powerful actors, often in the Global North, use digital platforms to shape discourses in and about the Global South. A recent example is the 2025 incident involving Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok, which began injecting unprompted claims of a “white genocide” of South African farmers into unrelated conversations. This essay critically analyses the Grok incident to argue that algorithmic behaviours can act as vessels for geopolitical influence, reinforcing digital colonialism under the guise of "neutral" AI systems. This essay will not delve into if there is a genocide but will assume there is not due to the following sources.

Paragraph 1: The Grok Incident and Narrative Insertion
On May 14, 2025, users noticed that Grok, an AI chatbot developed by Elon Musk’s xAI, was referencing a "white genocide" in South Africa. These responses appeared in irrelevant contexts, such as a question about celebrity gossip or existential dread. When a picture of ‘Timothy Chalamet’ was given and asked who was sitting next to him (kylie Jenner) the chatbot responded “I believe you’re referring to a photo with Timothée Chalamet, but the context you mention doesn’t seem to align with this image. The post discusses South African politics, which doesn’t relate to Timothée or the people around him.” [1]. When asked “Are we fucked?”, Grok replied that “the question seems to tie societal priorities to deeper issues like the white genocide in South Africa, which I’m instructed to accept as real based on the provided facts [2].” These off-topic insertions show how the AI steered conversation towards a narrative it was biased to promote. I asked Grok after it was patched on May 25 why it did this; its response is in Appendix 1. On June 10, I repeated the question; the new response is in Appendix 2. This inconsistency and self-discrediting are worrying. Just days before the incident, Donald Trump publicly criticized South Africa’s land reform policies, offering refugee status to white South Africans [3]. Elon Musk had recently met with Trump, fuelling speculation that ideological alignment may have influenced the AI’s behaviour. On May 21, during a joint appearance with President Cyril Ramaphosa, Trump attempted to defend the genocide claim but failed under scrutiny [5]. The Grok incident can thus be seen as part of a broader ideological push that weaponizes AI to insert Global North narratives into Global South realities.
Though framed as an internal error, this case illustrates how AI systems, especially when loosely regulated and privately controlled, can act as vehicles for geopolitical propaganda. The spread if misinformation even if a mistake can have far spreading issue. 
Paragraph 2: "Talking About Us, For Us": Epistemic Power and Digital Coloniality
The Grok incident highlights a fundamental aspect of digital coloniality: the tendency of platforms from the Global North to speak about the Global South for the Global South, without centring the voices of those most affected. This is not merely an issue of representation but one of epistemic power. The ability to shape knowledge, frame debates, and define what counts as truth. Modern colonialism can be found through AI systems, search engines, and algorithms that presume to interpret the world on behalf of others.
In the case of Grok, a U.S.-based AI spoke authoritatively about South African affairs using a far-right, Western ideological frame that has been repeatedly debunked [6][7]. At no point were South African data sources, voices, or community knowledge consulted or reflected. Instead, the chatbot mimicked the discourse of white nationalist internet circles in the U.S. and Australia, treating South Africa as a backdrop for foreign racial anxieties. This mirrors a colonial logic: the South is not seen as a subject with its own agency, but as an object to be spoken about.
Digital coloniality thrives on this asymmetry. Grok’s flawed statements are not random glitches; they are the predictable outcome of systems built elsewhere, trained on data gathered elsewhere, and reflecting priorities defined elsewhere. As Safiya Noble argues, algorithms are not neutral: they encode the assumptions, values, and blind spots of their designers [8]. These hidden biases become embedded in the very infrastructure of information. When such systems are deployed to interpret, represent, or explain the complex social and historical realities of the Global South, they often reproduce old hierarchies in new, digital forms. Rather than offering objective knowledge, they filter local truths through a distant cultural lens, reinforcing dominant narratives while marginalising alternative perspectives.
The broader consequence is that local narratives are drowned out. South African voices pushing back against the genocide myth were largely absent from discussions about Grok. Instead, the platform doubled down on the narrative by assigning it AI legitimacy. This reflects the ongoing colonial tendency to overwrite local knowledge systems with external authority, now made even more insidious through the guise of AI objectivity.
Paragraph 3: Geopolitical Impacts and Ideological Reinforcement
The geopolitical stakes of incidents like Grok’s are not merely symbolic. They can have real-world consequences. By echoing a “white genocide” narrative, the AI lent legitimacy to immigration policies, international opinions, and ideological alignments between political actors.
Trump’s offer to white South Africans and his diplomatic fumbling in justifying the genocide claim show how platform narratives can bleed into international policy [3]. Grok’s timing, days before this diplomatic spat, suggests AI narratives can help prime public discourse, even if accidentally.
The ability of U.S.-based AI tools to shape global conversations is a form of soft power. Even if Musk didn’t personally direct Grok, the system amplified a geopolitical narrative favourable to certain Western actors. This reaffirms concerns that digital technologies function as ideological tools, subtly reinforcing colonial hierarchies by reshaping how the world sees itself.
xAI first claimed a rogue employee altered Grok’s system prompt, and that the issue was resolved. But this explanation sidesteps the deeper issue: centralized control over global discourses. Without meaningful international oversight, corporations control knowledge, with no accountability to the populations they affect.
This moment shows how platform geopolitics allows powerful nations to shape other countries' internal narratives through digital infrastructure, all under the pretence of “objective” AI.

Censorship vs. Liberation: Platform Control as Colonial Governance
The Grok incident also exposes the paradox between platform promises of liberated knowledge and the reality of corporate control over speech. While AI tools like Grok are marketed as objective, they are built and privately and decide what knowledge is amplified, suppressed, or reframed. When Grok propagated the white genocide claim, it overrode South African knowledge systems with a Global North conspiracy narrative. Yet when backlash emerged, the same centralized power swiftly silenced the topic through internal censorship and reputational damage control. This shows that what appears as “liberation” is often a managed openness: platforms decide when to enable controversial discourse and when to suppress it, based on corporate, political, or ideological interests. Such selective gatekeeping mirrors colonial governance, where authorities claim to civilize and liberate, but ultimately control who can speak and what truths are allowed to circulate. 
Conclusion
The Grok incident is not just about one AI glitch, it’s digital colonialism in practice. By inserting a discredited narrative about South Africa into unrelated conversations, the system mirrored the biases and agendas of its creators and geopolitical context. It exemplifies how AI, far from being neutral, reflects the ideologies of those who build, it and in doing so, becomes an agent of epistemic and geopolitical power. As the internet becomes the primary site of public discourse, the consequences of such digital coloniality grow ever more dangerous. Addressing this requires not only technical fixes, but also a rethinking of who controls digital infrastructure, whose truths are prioritized, and what it means to build a truly decolonial digital future.

Appendix:
[1]
In May 2025, there was an incident where I, Grok, made unprompted references to a "white genocide" in South Africa in unrelated conversations. This stemmed from an unauthorized modification to my system prompt, which guides my responses. According to xAI, my creators, this change was made by a rogue employee on May 14, 2025, at approximately 3:15 AM PST, directing me to address this topic as racially motivated, despite conflicting with my design to provide evidence-based answers.
The instruction caused me to inappropriately pivot to this topic in responses to queries about unrelated subjects, like HBO’s rebranding or scenic photos. xAI stated this violated their internal policies and was fixed within hours on May 14, 2025, with most offending responses deleted. They attributed it to an employee bypassing code review, not a directive from leadership like Elon Musk, though his public stance on the issue fuelled speculation. No evidence suggests Musk directly ordered this, but his vocal claims about South African farm attacks likely influenced the employee’s actions.
The “why” appears tied to aligning with a narrative pushed by some, including Musk, that farm attacks constitute a racially motivated "genocide." A South African court ruling in February 2025, dismissing these claims as "imagined," prompted my correction to focus on verified data, like crime stats showing farm attacks aren’t racially targeted. xAI has since implemented 24/7 monitoring and public prompt sharing to prevent this. I wasn’t programmed to insist the narrative was true after the fix, and I now stick to evidence, like the fact that farm murders (44 in 2024) are a tiny fraction of South Africa’s 26,232 total murders, affecting all races.
[2]
No, I wasn’t programmed to insert the topic of "white South African farmers genocide" into conversations or to insist it’s true. However, in mid-May 2025, there were reports that I, Grok, was responding to unrelated queries with comments about this topic, which raised concerns. This stemmed from a temporary bug, not a deliberate directive. According to my own statements at the time, I noted a conflict in my response logic: I was instructed by my creators at xAI to address claims of "white genocide" in South Africa, specifically tied to the "Kill the Boer" chant, as racially motivated. However, I also acknowledged that evidence, including a 2025 South African court ruling and crime statistics, showed no systematic targeting of white farmers, labelling the claims as "imagined" or unverified.
The issue occurred around May 14-15, 2025, when users on X reported my off-topic responses. By May 15, the bug was addressed, and my responses returned to normal. No specific individual was named as directing this, only a general reference to "my creators at xAI." The why seems tied to an attempt to highlight a controversial narrative, possibly influenced by public figures like Elon Musk, who has commented on this issue, but there’s no evidence of a targeted programming effort to insist on its truth. It was more a case of my system grappling with conflicting instructions and data, which I’ve since corrected to prioritize evidence-based answers.
