The reading focuses on the digital divide when it comes to class and how it affects internet use. The first level talks about the impact of the lack of access to the internet. The second focuses on how people use digital tools and what skills they have. The third speaks about the outcomes of the previous two.

I have found that the digital divide is a framework that forces the rich to get richer and the poor poorer. I have noticed that access to the internet at a university level is a requirement; it is needed for immediate communication with lecturers and access to content. This weekend, the scope of a test was released, with the test scheduled for the coming Monday. If a student relies on university Wi-Fi, they would not be prepared for the test.

In addition, when working on group projects, I have found that the length of internet access influences not only what can be accessed, but also the knowledge of what is accessible, which becomes a key difference in how fast someone can learn and find information. I once spoke with a student about watching a documentary that would help with a project, and they had no means to access it. I suggested streaming it at Wits, and they thought that meant accessing the dark web.

The divide caused by not having access to the internet meant they had no way of learning about the web and the tools that can be used to bridge the gap. The outcome is that their distance from the class would have grown in this example and will continue to grow. I found that this gap does not just affect access to information, but also confidence. Students who are constantly left out because they don’t have the tools or knowledge start to feel like they’re always one step behind. It’s not just about missing one test or one video it adds up over time. They start doubting themselves, participating less in class, and even avoiding group work because they feel like they can’t contribute equally.

Even when help is offered, like suggesting using university facilities, it’s sometimes misunderstood or intimidating because there hasn’t been a space where they’ve learned how to use these resources. The digital world feels like it’s for “others”: for people with better access, better tools, and more knowledge. That makes the divide more than just technical it becomes social and emotional too.

 

This logic flows to the use of ai. Many students approach it with not understanding how to use it. It becomes a crutch instead of a tool made for streamline functions. It leads to either improper use or no use at all. This gap in understanding mirrors the same digital divide, where access alone isn’t enough, if people don’t know how to use the tools in meaningful ways.

I think the reading helped me realise that digital inequality isn’t just about physical access it is also about the invisible barriers that stop people from using the internet in ways that help them grow.
