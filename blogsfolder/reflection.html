                    My ui is meant to be simplistic, clear and clean. I wanted to have a visually non taxing websote that had bright emphasis colours to contrast dark backgorunds. The ui elements were rounded and soft shapes to help achieve an approachable and friendly  design .
                Folder structure 
                My folder structure is constructed to separate the main concepts of the website, using a tree-like or hierarchical information architecture. This approach mirrors how users navigate the site, beginning from the main idea (the homepage/profile) and branching out into focused sections such as blogs, designs, and projects. Additionally I separate the coding languages into the HTML, JavaScript and CSS, this is to add clarity and reduce confusion in the code, as having multiple languages in a script would quickly get too messy. Additionally, all three play a different role in my website and this separation helps illustrate that. The html is the skeleton, it is the structure of the website providing the base definition of the content and dividing the content into understandable chunks. The css is used to help define the website as mine, with the styling and visual structure. The JavaScript helps in supporting the two by making the structure and visual element more dynamic. 
                The folder structure reflects the top-level priorities of the site: The homepage (index.html) sits at the root, acting as the primary entry point. Dedicated folders like blogsfolder, designfolder, and devfolder contain content related to specific topics or project areas. The structure is also modular and scalable. For example If I add a new section like contactfolder or galleryfolder, the structure supports that without confusion. The naming is simple are consistent and descriptive, which helps avoid conflicts and makes collaboration straightforward. All components (CSS, JS and HTML)  can be reused or updated independently.
                I used semantic HTML elements to provide meaningful structure and clarity to my website’s content. Elements such as nav, header, main, footer, and section help both browsers and assistive technologies understand the layout and hierarchy of information. This improves usability by enabling features like screen readers to interpret content more effectively, which enhances accessibility for users with disabilities.
                To improve readability and maintainability, I intentionally minimized the use of generic div and span tags in favour of more descriptive elements. For instance, figure was used to wrap images with captions and alt text, improving both accessibility and semantic clarity. Content was divided into p tags for paragraphs and ul/li for lists, which clearly indicate grouped items. The a tag was used not only for navigation but also for linking internal sections with unique IDs, supporting better user navigation.
                My HTML structure is organized into a  section—containing metadata, external stylesheet links, and page information—and a body section, which holds the actual content. Navigation is structured using nav and list elements to group page links clearly. The main element contains the core content of each page, and the footer marks the end of the document, often containing attribution or contact details.
                In terms of usability, using semantic tags made it much easier to navigate and manage the content—not just for me, but for users as well. The browser and screen readers can recognize each section properly, which allows users to skip straight to the content they need, like jumping to the nav or main content without having to go through everything manually. This improves the experience, especially for people using keyboard navigation or assistive tools.
                Accessibility was also improved through this structure. For example, a screen reader can announce a section as "navigation" or "main content" based on the tag, without needing extra labels. This helps users with visual impairments understand the structure of the page more clearly. Even just using figure with proper alt text makes sure that images aren’t meaningless to someone using a screen reader.

                Overall, semantic markup has made my code more intuitive, easier to debug, and significantly more accessible. It ensures that both users and machines can understand and navigate my site more efficiently.



                Each page includes comprehensive metadata to guide the browser and improve search engine visibility. I use:
                •	meta charset for proper character encoding
                •	meta viewport for responsive behavior
                •	meta description for concise page summaries
                •	meta author and meta keywords 
                This metadata is modular, so updates are easy and consistent across the site. I also integrate microformats like h-entry, p-name, and e-content to help screen readers and web scrapers understand content context and structure more precisely.

                With my css I attempted to create a uniform layout, colour scheme and overall pattern across my website. This was achieved by having an overall CSS script that was attached to each page. From here I coded individual CSS for each page to give a unique but intuitive feel to each page. The code I’m most proud of in terms of the CSS are the dual column for the blog page. This is a simple layout however I found coding this to be quite difficult as getting the write balance of width as well as finetuning how the code operated in different screen sizes to be a massive undertaking. I enjoyed giving hover over image effect as it felt like that gave my website weight and actual completion. I attempted to give my entire website adaptable screen size layouts , this worked to some degree and I did try to do this with pure CSS and media queries which might be the reason I struggled to such an extent. I think an integration with JavaScript for this would be something I want to focus on in the future.

                I use JavaScript to make certain interactions dynamic as well as implementing an API. I implemented the JavaScript to make my hamburger menu. It allowed me to alter the websites reactiveness and allowed for more dynamic. I began exploring the effects that I can achieve with JavaScript and ended up playing around with reactive backgrounds. I found this to be the most exciting implementation, as it creating a tracking for the user and became really exciting to play around with. However, it was too loud, and I feel that it destroyed the feeling that I was going for, so I shelfed it and it is now only available on a page in the project page.  I made use of APIs to achieve get some fun facts about cats and explore my other interest of graphic novels. I think that in future I want to develop my own database of graphic novels I have personally read and attempt to call from it like an API. This will achieve what I actually wanted as a way to spread the novels I was personally interested in.
