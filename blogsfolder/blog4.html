          <h2>Reflecting on My Wireframes</h2>
          <p>
            Looking back at the wireframes I originally created, it's clear that I was quite confused about good design practices and what I actually liked about other websites. My initial design was impractical because it didn’t even include a navigation bar. I relied on single links scattered vertically across the page to connect to other sections. Without setting a consistent structure for my website, it became difficult to navigate, and as a result, it lacked functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wasn’t sure how to guide users through my site, so I added awkward columns at the bottom of the visible page as a poor attempt at navigation. At that stage, I didn’t yet understand the purpose of footers or how to use other visual cues that could look much cleaner and more intentional. For example, I could have used simple borders around the top and sides of the page to visually suggest scrolling, or even a transparent arrow that subtly fades downward as a gentle hint. I’ve since realized that most users naturally expect a page to be scrollable unless it's clearly shown otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another issue with my wireframes was that they included elements that weren’t actually HTML, because I wasn’t sure what should be handled with CSS, JavaScript, or HTML. This was simply due to a lack of experience at the time.
          </p>
        
          <h2>Design Challenges</h2>
          <p>
            The biggest struggle for Assignment 1 was figuring out the design and actually filling out the different pages with meaningful content. I found it difficult to plan out the structure of each page and decide what belonged where, especially since I wasn’t sure how to create a logical flow or what information was unnecessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also found that working with images and navigation within a page was particularly intimidating. Trying to create a page that allowed users to find the information they were looking for while also keeping the content organized and not overwhelming was a huge challenge. Each page risked becoming overloaded with information.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was difficult to balance showing large amounts of information versus offering brief summaries or previews before diving into detail. In the end, I chose to cut a lot of information and instead included links at the top of each page that direct users to different parts of the content. I also made use of icons to visually represent and break up information in a way that makes the site easier to explore.
          </p>
        
          <h2>Design Section</h2>
          <p>
            This website was created as a portfolio to showcase my work and achievements so far. My design is focused on creating an intuitive and simple way to explore everything I’ve done. I want to strike a balance between being professional and relaxed, as the site should represent me personally while still appealing to those I want to showcase it to.
          </p>
        
          <h3>2a. User Interface (UI)</h3>
          <p>The main elements of my UI design include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A navigation bar that is always present and consistent across all pages.</li>
            <li>Icons for coding languages I am proficient in, acting as visual cues for my technical skills.</li>
            <li>A white background paired with pastel colours, giving a clean, minimal look that highlights content without overwhelming it.</li>
            <li>Rounded corners used throughout to create a friendly and relaxed feel.</li>
            <li>Standard components like a header and footer, contributing to a well-organized and easy-to-navigate layout.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Although I haven’t finalized the typography yet, I’m aiming for a clean, modern font that works well with the soft pastel theme and ensures good readability.
          </p>
        
          <h3>2b. User Experience (UX)</h3>
          <p>Since this is a portfolio, accessibility and ease of navigation are my top priorities:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Users should be able to browse smoothly, whether on desktop or mobile.</li>
            <li>A sticky navigation bar allows quick access to different sections without having to scroll back up.</li>
            <li>Clear contact options, making it easy for users to get in touch with me directly.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h2>Reference Material and Inspirations</h2>
          <p>
            One of my main inspirations is Adham Dannaway's website.
          </p>
          <p>What I like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The clean and simple layout.</li>
            <li>Effective use of space and minimalism, keeping things uncluttered.</li>
            <li>The homepage image that cleverly shifts between programming-focused and creative-focused visuals — a great way to represent a dual skill set.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>What I don’t like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Some sections feel a bit too formal and robotic, which isn’t the vibe I’m going for. I want something more inviting and casual.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h2>Colour Palette</h2>
          <p>
            Although I haven’t chosen a final font yet, I’ve already put together a color palette that will define the site's visual style:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Primary Colours:</li>
            <li>Deep Teal: #0F5257</li>
            <li>Pastel Blue: #8DA9C4</li>
            <li>Warm Red: #AA4465</li>
            <li>Accent and Background Colours:</li>
            <li>Soft Cream: #FAF0CA</li>
            <li>Light Cream: #FAF8D4</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These colours are meant to create a calm and approachable vibe, which is ideal for a portfolio that aims to be both professional and welcoming.</p>
