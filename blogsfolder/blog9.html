Digital Divide Widens
Internet Access is a Fundamental Right. Especially, Amidst a Pandemic

In the later 2 questions are proposed  
 
The first is of economic and social interest. Should all citizens have access to the internet - regardless of income - and if so, are governments supposed to take care of it?

The second question is purely political. What should be the rules governing the internet and who will set them?

1)
Should the world follow India’s way and have internet be a right? On paper there this seems like a perfect answer. This would increase the reach of all information and allow for the closing of the digital divide. However free internet would require a large sum of money to be provided from large computers to actual infrastructure. This burden would fall largely on governments, many of which are already struggling with financial constraints and inefficiencies. In countries where public services like healthcare, education, and transportation are already underfunded, adding internet infrastructure could strain resources even further. Without strong systems of accountability and transparency, there is a risk that funds could be mismanaged, leaving citizens without the promised services.

2)
I find the who would set them to be the most interesting question. If each country were to set up their own individual rules and regulations, it would be difficult to build websites for world use and could limit knowledge. A singular entity that had control over the internet rules would hold the insane amount of power of controlling humans bank of knowledge. The risk of censorship, manipulation, or bias would be very real. Establishing fair, transparent, and democratic global governance for the internet would be extremely difficult, especially in a world where nations have vastly different political systems, values, and interests. I don’t think a central institution would be beneficial for defining rules. A United Nations type organisation might work better. This could provide multiple angles and perspectives on how rules should be created.
