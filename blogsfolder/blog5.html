              This website was created as a portfolio to showcase my work and achievements so far. My design focuses on creating an intuitive and simple way to explore everything I’ve done. I aim to strike a balance between being professional and relaxed, as the site should represent me personally while still appealing to the people I want to showcase it to.
            
              Comparing those early wireframes with my current designs, I can see a significant improvement in how I approach both structure and user experience. My new wireframes are much more organized, featuring clearly defined sections and consistent layouts across pages. Each page now has a specific purpose and is properly titled, helping users know where they are and what to expect.
            
              <br><br>
            
              <strong>Goal Alignment</strong><br>
              My goal has always been to create a portfolio that is both professional and reflective of my personal style, and I believe my current designs are much closer to achieving that balance.
            
              <br><br>
            
              <strong>Information Structure – Content Mapping</strong><br>
              The pages I now include are:
            
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Homepage:</strong> Introduction to who I am, with clear text about me and navigation to other sections.</li>
                <li><strong>Blogs Page:</strong> A space to share blog posts, with placeholders for text and blog titles.</li>
                <li><strong>Design Page:</strong> Dedicated to showcasing my design work, including text descriptions and images.</li>
                <li><strong>Projects Page:</strong> A gallery-style layout to highlight key projects with descriptions and visuals.</li>
                <li><strong>Profile Page:</strong> Focused on my background, achievements, and personal statement, with supporting images.</li>
              </ul>
            
              <br>
            
              <strong>User Flow – Screens, Behaviour, and Decisions</strong><br>
              Each page now connects logically to the others. I’ve added a navigation bar that is consistent across all pages — something that was missing from my early designs. This makes it much easier for users to move between pages without frustration.
            
              In redesigning the wireframes, I focused heavily on improving the user experience (UX). I considered how users would move through the site, ensuring that each page is accessible and that information is presented in a way that doesn’t overwhelm.
            
              <br><br>
            
              <strong>List and Explanation of Selected Interface Elements</strong>
            
              <ul>
                <li>A navigation bar that is always visible and consistent across all pages.</li>
                <li>Icons for the coding languages I am proficient in, serving as visual cues for my technical skills.</li>
                <li>Rounded corners used throughout to create a friendly and relaxed feel.</li>
                <li>Standard components like a header and footer for a well-organized layout.</li>
                <li>Clear contact options, making it easy for users to get in touch with me.</li>
                <li>A sticky navigation bar that allows quick access to sections without scrolling back up.</li>
              </ul>
            
              <br>
            
              <strong>Style Process Documentation</strong><br>
              I haven’t finalized the typography yet, but I’m aiming for a clean, modern font that complements the soft pastel theme and ensures good readability.
            
              I have chosen a colour palette that will define the site's visual style:
            
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary Colours:</strong> Deep Teal (#0F5257), Pastel Blue (#8DA9C4), Warm Red (#AA4465)</li>
                <li><strong>Accent and Background Colours:</strong> Soft Cream (#FAF0CA), Light Cream (#FAF8D4)</li>
              </ul>
            
              These colours are intended to create a calm and approachable vibe — ideal for a portfolio that is both professional and welcoming.

              <strong>Reference Material</strong><br>
              One of my main inspirations is Adham Dannaway's website.

              <em>What I like:</em>
              <ul>
                <li>The clean and simple layout.</li>
                <li>Effective use of space and minimalism, which keeps things uncluttered.</li>
                <li>The homepage image that shifts between programming- and creative-focused visuals — a great way to represent a dual skill set.</li>
              </ul>
            
              <em>What I don’t like:</em>
              <ul>
                <li>Some sections feel too formal and robotic, which isn’t the vibe I’m going for. I want something more inviting and casual.</li>
              </ul>
