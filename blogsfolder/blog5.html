            This website was created as a portfolio to showcase my work and achievements so far. My design is focused on creating an intuitive and simple way to explore everything I’ve done. I want to strike a balance between being professional and relaxed, as the site should represent me personally while still appealing to those, I want to showcase it to.

            Comparing those early wireframes with my current designs, I can see a significant improvement in how I approach both structure and user experience. My new wireframes are much more organized, featuring clearly defined sections and consistent layouts across pages. Each page now has a specific purpose and is properly titled, helping users know where they are and what to expect.
            
             
            
            
            Goal Alignment
            
            My goal has always been to create a portfolio that is both professional and reflective of my personal style, and I believe my current designs are much closer to achieving that balance.
            
             
            
            
            Information Structure - Content Mapping
            
            The pages I now include are:
            
            Homepage: Introduction to who I am, with clear text about me and navigation to other sections.
            Blogs Page: A space to share blog posts, with placeholders for text and blog titles
            Design Page: Dedicated to showcasing my design work, including space for text descriptions and images.
            Projects Page: A gallery-style page to highlight key projects, including descriptions and supporting visuals.
            Profile Page: Focused on my background, achievements, and personal statement, with additional text and images.
            
             
            
            
            User Flow - Screens, Behaviour, and Decisions
            
            Each page connects logically to the others, and I now have a navigation bar that is consistent across all pages — something I had completely missed in my early wireframes. The navigation bar makes it easy for users to move between pages without frustration.
            
            In redesigning the wireframes, I focused heavily on improving the user experience (UX). I considered how users would move through the site, ensuring that each page is easy to access, and that information is presented in a way that doesn't overwhelm the reader.
            
             
            
            
            List and Explanation of Selected Interface Elements
            
            A navigation bar that is always present and consistent across all pages.
            Icons for coding languages I am proficient in, acting as visual cues for my technical skills.
            Rounded corners used throughout to create a friendly and relaxed feel.
            Standard components like a header and footer, contributing to a well-organized and easy-to-navigate layout.
            Clear contact options, making it easy for users to get in touch with me directly.
            Sticky navigation bar allows quick access to different sections without having to scroll back up.
            
             
            
            
            Style Process Documentation
            
            Although I haven’t finalized the typography yet, I’m aiming for a clean, modern font that works well with the soft pastel theme and ensures good readability.
            
            Although I haven’t chosen a final font yet, I’ve already put together a colour palette that will define the site's visual style:
            
            Primary Colours: Deep Teal: #0F5257, Pastel Blue: #8DA9C4, Warm Red: #AA4465
            Accent and Background Colours: Soft Cream: #FAF0CA, Light Cream: #FAF8D4
            
             
            
             
            
             
            
            Reference Material
            
            One of my main inspirations is Adham Dannaway's website.
            
            What I like:
            
            The clean and simple layout.
            Effective use of space and minimalism, keeping things uncluttered.
            The homepage image that cleverly shifts between programming-focused and creative-focused visuals — a great way to represent a dual skill set.
            
            What I don’t like:
            
            Some sections feel a bit too formal and robotic, which isn’t the vibe I’m going for. I want something more inviting and casual.
