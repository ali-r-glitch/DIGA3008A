    <strong>Readings:</strong>  
    <em>The Library of Babel</em> by Jorge Luis Borges (1941);  
    <em>A Revealing Look at the Dot-Com Bubble of 2000, and How It Shapes Our Lives Today</em> by Brian McCullough;  
    <em>Flash and Its History on the Web</em>
  </p>

  <p class="e-content">
    <strong>GitHub Experience:</strong><br>
    My experience with GitHub is always a bit tumultuous. It usually starts well ,setting it up is quick and painless , but updating it becomes problematic. I found publishing my empty website surprisingly easy. In just a few steps, I had created and shared a path to my site with the world.
  </p>

  <p class="e-content">
    Borges’ <em>The Library of Babel</em> suddenly felt very relatable. In this short story, Borges describes a universe where every possible piece of writing ( both truth and falsehood ) exists within an infinite labyrinth of books. Similarly, the internet, which can be seen as a modern library of human knowledge, is a chaotic network where anyone can add content, including empty and useless websites like mine.
  </p>

  <p class="e-content">
    This activity made me reflect on how oversaturation of information can dilute the value of meaningful knowledge. If everything is accessible, useful content becomes buried under noise. Could we be heading toward a future where the internet is so cluttered that finding anything substantial becomes nearly impossible?
  </p>

  <p class="e-content">
    <strong>Flash & The Dot-Com Bubble:</strong><br>
    The second set of readings, about Flash and the dot-com bubble, shared strikingly similar narrative arcs. Both start with innovation, experience rapid (and unsustainable) growth due to overvaluation, and eventually collapse under their own weight. 
  </p>

  <p class="e-content">
    In the case of the dot-com bubble, massive investments flowed into countless startups, inflating their value far beyond their actual potential. I see parallels today with the rise of Generative AI (GAI). Companies like OpenAI experienced skyrocketing investments despite large operational losses. When DeepSeek’s AI was released and outperformed OpenAI’s in some areas, it exposed the overvaluation of their tech, a modern echo of the bubble pop.

    <strong>Cool Things on the Internet:</strong><br>
    I’ve recently been fascinated by mathematical simulations like <em>Conway’s Game of Life</em> and <em>Langton’s Ant</em>. These systems are based on very simple rules but can produce surprisingly complex and beautiful patterns. 
  </p>

  <p class="e-content">
    In <em>Game of Life</em>, each square in a grid is either alive or dead. A living cell dies if it has fewer than three neighbors and is born if it has exactly three. Despite its simplicity, the system can create mesmerizing patterns and even reach equilibrium states. One creator even used the system to build a functioning clock.
  </p>

  <p class="e-content">
    These simulations touch on deep concepts like mathematical curiosity, computational theory, and self-organization in complex systems. I find it calming to experiment with them, trying to create sustainable patterns or surprising structures.
  </p>

  <p class="e-content">
    <strong>My Goals for the Course:</strong><br>
    I want to dive deeper into the coding intricacies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. More importantly, I aim to understand what makes a good user interface. I often struggle with creating simple and user-friendly UI in my games. Through this course, I hope to learn the theories and practices that make UI intuitive and engaging.
