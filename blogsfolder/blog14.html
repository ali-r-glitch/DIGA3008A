   Art
Art to me has always been about asking a question. To ethically ask that question and allow it to be just, there are some key ideas that must be considered when creating an art piece.

Inspiration vs Appropriation?
Art from other cultures is fascinating because it offers a window into how others live, think, and understand the world. It’s a powerful way to learn and connect. However, “there is a line between harmless inspiration and cultural appropriation, an act that can leave many people feeling disrespected, offended, and exploited.”

Being able to draw inspiration in a respectful way can be difficult. It requires awareness and sensitivity. Using cultural elements without understanding their meanings or significance can lead to harm, even when the intent is good. As Y Studios puts it, “Although those looking to other cultures for inspiration may be sincere in their efforts, it's easy to unknowingly cross the line into cultural appropriation and cause emotional harm to the people who cherish their heritage.”

Respectful inspiration means learning the context, listening to those from the culture, and giving credit where it's due. It’s not just about aesthetic, it’s about meaning and history. I find that using it purely for aesthetics is where the blatant cultural appropriation comes from. However exploring the context and meaning does not allow an artist to speak for a culture, this also leads to cultural appropriation.

Coding, like art, is a creative medium. It’s not just technical, it’s expressive. Whether building a website, designing a game, or developing an app, its crafting experiences that communicate ideas and values. That means the same responsibilities apply.
Just like in art, inspiration in coding often comes from what others have done before us. We might be influenced by aesthetics from different cultures, symbols, languages, or traditions when designing user interfaces, soundscapes, or storylines. But pulling these elements in without understanding their roots can lead to digital forms of appropriation.</p>
