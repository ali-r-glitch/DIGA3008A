          <h2>Development Focus</h2>
          <p>
            This week I focused on building the bones of my website. I worked on folder structure, traversal between pages, the functionality of jump links, and implementation of images and videos. I focused on the actual HTML “code” this week.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found it quite different from any other languages I have used — it felt like describing what I wanted to do instead of coding in the traditional sense. The learning curve wasn’t steep due to the simplistic tags and functionality that I started with.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the future of my website, it seems that my issues will mainly lie in the actual design and not the code to pull it off. I felt this way as I spent a disproportionate amount of time on simple text layout.
          </p>
      
          <h2>Intended Audience & Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            I expect that the users of my website will be possible employers or colleagues. I wish to use this website as a portfolio — the people using my website will be intending to learn what I have done and what I can do. I will attempt to achieve this by showcasing projects I have previously done.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this in mind, the experience I wish for the users to have must be accomplished with a website that is professional, intelligently mapped, clean, and polished.
          </p>
      
          <h2>Design & Navigation Plans</h2>
          <p>
            My design will be focused on creating a:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Home page</li>
            <li>Design page</li>
            <li>Blog page</li>
            <li>Profile page</li>
            <li>Game Dev page</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each page will have a sticky navigation bar to allow the user to freely access any section at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Home page will contain minimal information and give a brief overview of the website. I will include an interactive image that changes based on where the user is hovering — showing either "Digital Arts" or "Engineering". Clicking on either section will redirect the user to the Game Dev or Design pages respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Blog page will feature a navigation bar on the left listing each blog title. The user can jump to any selected blog.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Game Dev page will showcase games I’ve made, similar to how they appear on my Itch.io page. The Design page will include recent electronic or software projects. The Profile page will feature my skills, interests, and contact information — with icons for each platform linked appropriately. This will serve as a personal promotional space.
          </p>
      
          <h2>Folder Structure</h2>
          <p>
            My folder structure will include directories for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Scripts</li>
            <li>Images</li>
            <li>Styles</li>
            <li>Each individual page (with their own scripts)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This structure allows for simple filing and scalability.
          </p>
