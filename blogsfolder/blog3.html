            This week I focused on building the bones of my website. I focused on folder structure, traversal between pages, the functionality of jump links and implementation of images and videos. I focused on the actual html “code” this week. I found it quite different from any other languages I have used, it felt like describing what I wanted to do instead of coding (writing lines of instructions). The learning curve was not steep due to the simplistic tags and functionality that I started with. For the future of my website, it seems that my issues will mainly in the actual design and not the code to pull it off. I felt this way as I spent a disproportionate amount of time on simple text layout.

            I expect that the users of my website will be possible employers or colleagues. I wish to use this website as a portfolio and thus the people using my websites will be intending to learn what I have done and what I can do. I will attempt to achieve this by showcasing projects I have previously done. With this in mind, the experience I wish for the users to have must be accomplished with a website that us professional, intelligently mapped, clean and polished. My design will be focused on creating a…
            Mapping 
            The pages my portfolio will contain is a home, design, blog, profile and game dev pages. Each page will have a sticky navigation bar. I want the user to have the ability to freely access any page at any time. The home page will have minimal information but will give a brief overview of the website. I will have an interactive image that will either display an image with the words digital arts or engineering based on where the user is hovering the mouse. The image can either take the user to game dev or design based on if they click on digital arts or engineering. The blog page will have a navigation bar on the left which will have every blogs name. the user will be able to jump to any blog they select. The game dev will have descriptions of the games I want to showcase similar to my itch page. The design page will have recent electronic or software projects I wish to showcase. The profile page will house all my basic skills, interests and all of my contact information and details using a combination of images to showcase the different platforms with links to them. This will be a page dedicated to making a page to explore and sell myself.
            
            My folder structured will compose of the folders for scripts, images, styles and each page. In each page’s folders there will be folders for scripts, this will be for pages specific functionality. This structure will allow me for easy filing and expansion if necessary.
