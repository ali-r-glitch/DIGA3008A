        Readings: The Library of Babel, by Jorge Luis Borges (1941); A revealing look at the dot-com bubble of 2000 — and how it shapes our lives today , by Brian McCullough;Flash And Its History On The Web

 


        Readings and experience with setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages.
        
        My experience with GitHub is always a tumultuous experience that starts off well. A process that is quick and painless to setup but problematic to update. I found that publishing my empty website shocking easily. In a few steps I have created and shared a path to my website with the world. I found the reading I had completed of
        Jorge Luis Borgess “The tower of babel” to become too relatable too quickly. In this paper Borgess poses a situation in which everything that can be written is written and hence all truth and falsehood is placed in a jumbled labyrinth. The internet that may be considered the sum of human knowledge is a network in which anyone can add information to. Including an empty and useless website that may add to the confusion and inaccessibility of important and useful information. I found that a simple activity would be dissolving useful information that will lead to the ever-growing issue of oversaturation of information, until any information added is so infinitesimal small that it will not be able to have any impact to the network of knowledge. Could this lead to the internet being a useless or impractical tool in which attempting to find anything of substance near impossible?
        
         
        
        
        The second set of readings focused on the flash and the bubble pop. I found that both readings had very similar story beats. They began with a new idea or new way to use technology. They both grew at an unsustainable rate due to the overevaluation of product/software, where they eventually became redundant and collapsed. With the dot com bubble, it grew due to investors pouring money into many startups. I find that the rave of GAI to be a comparable problem in recent times. Open ai, once the undisputed leader in the GAI space had been experiencing massive losses from operational costs alone. The company investments were still insanely high. This came to a massive crash when deep seeks ai was released which highlighted the overvaluation of the OpenAI’s software.
        
         
        
        
        Cool things on the internet
        
        I have been looking at the emergence of mathematical models that are used to simulate systems that have simple rules. Things like “Conway's Game of Life” and “Langton’s Ant”. The basics of the former’s simulation is there are a grid of blocks, a block can either be alive or dead. An alive block will die if there are less than 3 neighbours and be born if it has 3 or more neighbours. I found that simple pattern creation created through the mathematical simulation can create a calming and artistic feeling. I’ve found myself getting lost in attempting to create new patterns for myself have some satisfying patterns or equilibrium/sustainable states. Its interesting to find the advancements that some people have created including someone who created a clock using the system. Its hard if not impossible to pinpoint the exact reason for the creation of these types of simulations. However, the concepts explore mathematical curiosity, computational theory, and the study of self-organization in complex systems. These could be the reasons for the conception of these simulations.
        
         
        
        
        My goals for the course
        
        I want to really delve deep into the coding intricacy of html, css and javascripts. However, my main goal is to focus on understanding what makes a good UI. I found that I always struggle to make simple and user-friendly UI when making games and hence want to focus on theories and practices to male Ui easily digestible, to enhance usability and engagement

        File Structure
        The file structure will be laid out  where the root file will be the main folder which houses all other folders. It will contain folders index, blog, design, profile, portfolio (all folders just mentioned will have folders with code specific for them), scripts, images, styles. This simple layout will allow for easy access to all folders and ease traversal between the pages. The images and styles folders may need to be modifies so that there is a dedicated folder for each sub folder (eg an images and styles folder in the Index folder) just for speed and efficiency reasons however that will have to be tested further along the line. 
        
        Root(DIGA3008A)
        Index 
            Index specific code
            Blog
                Blog specific code
            Design
                Design specific code
            Profile 
                Profile specific code
            Portfolio
                Portfolio specific code
            Scripts
            Images
            Styles
        My URL will simply be the username of my GitHub followed by the path to the page based on the hierarchy listed above. For example, the Blog page will be ali-r-glitch.github.io/DIGA3008A/Blogs. This is to keep the hierarchy digestible and keep traversal as simple as possible.
        
        Wireframes and ideas. There are a few ideas that I want to see come to life. 
        Ideas 1: simple
        A simple and straightforward website with simple code.
        
           
        Idea 2: Images
        Using static or animated images that the user can’t interact with. I would like to use images related to me as a digital arts engineer. For example I would like to use a game controller for the homepage where each button would represent a page on the website.  
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Idea 3: maps 
        Im inspired by the websites of  Immersive Gardens[1]. A 3D map like website in which the user can explore and move around in. The user can hover over a piece of land which will highlight it. If clicked the camera user will be moved to that area. 
        
        Reflection on the world wide web
        I find the word interaction difficult in itself. My understanding of it is a predictable or non-random reaction to user input that may change the context or content of the text. My struggle in understanding the definition is what level of cognitive effort is required to be considered user input. Based on context and the user personally, something could be interactive. A hypothetical person who has never used technology would find no computer, mouse interaction or website interactive. The subjectivity of a concept that I thought was originally simple has changed my perception of the world wide web. When designing the Ui for the website I think I might fail to grapple with when to use links, previews and how to create a flow of the website so that the website is predictable yet interesting to view. The balance of knowing what is coming but interestingly presented might be difficult to achieve.  
        
        Reflection on the reading “You want a revolution?”
        
        In the reading I found the most interesting point made was what hypertext would make obsolete. In the text it states that books would not become obsolete, but post literacy would be obsolete. I understand post literacy as the people losing interest in using and engaging with traditional forms of reading and writing. This poses that the implementation of the non linear “storytelling” ability of hypertext would revitalise reading and writing in a new interactive manner. I find this to be true in my experience as I struggle to enjoy reading, however it hypertext makes gathering of information easier and  quicker due to the non linearity as I may quickly go to more information on a term I unsure of or skip ahead of needless information that I am informed about. This does create a medium in which I enjoy reading.
