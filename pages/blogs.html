        Readings: The Library of Babel, by Jorge Luis Borges (1941); A revealing look at the dot-com bubble of 2000 — and how it shapes our lives today , by Brian McCullough;Flash And Its History On The Web

 


        Readings and experience with setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages.
        
        My experience with GitHub is always a tumultuous experience that starts off well. A process that is quick and painless to setup but problematic to update. I found that publishing my empty website shocking easily. In a few steps I have created and shared a path to my website with the world. I found the reading I had completed of
        Jorge Luis Borgess “The tower of babel” to become too relatable too quickly. In this paper Borgess poses a situation in which everything that can be written is written and hence all truth and falsehood is placed in a jumbled labyrinth. The internet that may be considered the sum of human knowledge is a network in which anyone can add information to. Including an empty and useless website that may add to the confusion and inaccessibility of important and useful information. I found that a simple activity would be dissolving useful information that will lead to the ever-growing issue of oversaturation of information, until any information added is so infinitesimal small that it will not be able to have any impact to the network of knowledge. Could this lead to the internet being a useless or impractical tool in which attempting to find anything of substance near impossible?
        
         
        
        
        The second set of readings focused on the flash and the bubble pop. I found that both readings had very similar story beats. They began with a new idea or new way to use technology. They both grew at an unsustainable rate due to the overevaluation of product/software, where they eventually became redundant and collapsed. With the dot com bubble, it grew due to investors pouring money into many startups. I find that the rave of GAI to be a comparable problem in recent times. Open ai, once the undisputed leader in the GAI space had been experiencing massive losses from operational costs alone. The company investments were still insanely high. This came to a massive crash when deep seeks ai was released which highlighted the overvaluation of the OpenAI’s software.
        
         
        
        
        Cool things on the internet
        
        I’ve been looking at the emergence of mathematical models that are used to simulate systems that have simple rules. Things like “Conway's Game of Life” and “Langton’s Ant”. The basics of the former’s simulation is there are a grid of blocks, a block can either be alive or dead. An alive block will die if there are less than 3 neighbours and be born if it has 3 or more neighbours. I found that simple pattern creation created through the mathematical simulation can create a calming and artistic feeling. I’ve found myself getting lost in attempting to create new patterns for myself have some satisfying patterns or equilibrium/sustainable states. Its interesting to find the advancements that some people have created including someone who created a clock using the system. Its hard if not impossible to pinpoint the exact reason for the creation of these types of simulations. However, the concepts explore mathematical curiosity, computational theory, and the study of self-organization in complex systems. These could be the reasons for the conception of these simulations.
        
         
        
        
        My goals for the course
        
        I want to really delve deep into the coding intricacy of html, css and javascripts. However, my main goal is to focus on understanding what makes a good UI. I found that I always struggle to make simple and user-friendly UI when making games and hence want to focus on theories and practices to male Ui easily digestible, to enhance usability and engagement
